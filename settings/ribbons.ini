# ribbons.ini instructions for use.
#
# This file is used by TTT3 to display and render dress uniform ribbons. The contents of this file will also trigger TTT3 to dynamically re-write
# '\data\ribbons_g.inc' at runtime, meaning to add a new ribbon, a user need only edit this file and copy the required ribbon image files to the 
# '\data\ribbons' folder.
# 
# 1 - Awards are identified as a section e.g. [moi]
#
# 2 - All awards MUST have a 'name' option. This option defines how the award will be listed in the 'Medals, Ribbons and Wings' left hand 
#     list widget as well as the right hand groupbox title and the ribbon checkbox if applicable. e.g. name = Medal of Instruction (MoI)
#
# 3 - All awards MUST have a 'type' option. A ribbon's type defines TTT's behavior in regard to displaying and rendering the ribbon(s).
#     TTT3 supports the following ribbon types:
#
#     upgradeable -  Offers the user with a checkbox to indicate a ribbon of this category has been awarded. If the checkbox is selected
#                    then a selection of single selection radio buttions (defined by each 'upgrade#' option) is offered to the user to 
#                    indicate which level of ribbon has been awarded. A MAXIMUM of 6 upgrades is permitted. 
#                    TTT3 will then render the single ribbon that has been selected.
#
#     subRibbons -   Offers the user with a selection of spinboxes that indicate the number of ribbons in each upgrade catagory that have 
#                    been awarded. A MAXIMUM of 8 upgrades is permitted. All ribbons with a value greater than 0 will be rendered unless 
#                    hard coded not to. 
#
#     multiRibbon -  Similar to the above subRibbons type but only supports a single ribbon. Only ONE upgrade is permitted.
#
#     ranged -       Offers the user with a checkbox to indicate a ribbon of this category has been awarded. If the checkbox is selected 
#                    a single spinbox will be shown to reflect the level awarded.
#                    The ranged type has the following mandantory options:
#
#                    rangeMin = Defines the start of the numerical range e.g. 1
#                    rangeMax = Defines the end of the numerical range e.g. 39
#                    incrementName = Defines the name of the range to be displayed in TTT3 next to the spinbox e.g. Echelon
#                    filename = Defines the filename of the ribbon file to be used. &RANGE& is to be inserted where the range 
#                    number would reside e.g. ov-&RANGE&e.gif for ov-19e.gif
#
# 4 - Each ribbon (apart from a ranged type) is defined by an 'upgrade#' option in the format of 'Ribbon Name (RN)'. Ribbon Name defines the 
#     text that TTT3 will display next to the award in the 'Medals, Ribbons and Wings' tab. The section in brackets, '(RN)' MUST reflect 
#     the filename of the ribbon in '\data\ribbons\'. e.g. upgrade1 = single/initial (MoI) is used for: 
#     "TTT3\data\ribbons\moi.gif".
