                <h2>1. Introduction: What is TTT?</h2>
                TIECorps Tailoring Tool 3 is a program for creating EH TC
                uniforms.<br>
                Since the template files for the uniforms are 3D models, which
                not too many people can easily work with, this tool is for
                assembling the uniform parts from given personnel data (either
                entered via the GUI or imported from the TC database).<br>
                TTT3 generates a preview in OpenGL, allowing the user to
                comfortably set camera position, lighting and some other
                options, and finally renders the final uniform image by calling
                POV-Ray (the Persistence of Vision raytracer).<br>
                <br>
                While it would have been easier and faster to just render out
                template pictures and have TTT put them together, as the first
                version of the program did, there would have been some
                disadvantages.<br>
                First, when putting images together that look 3D, but are only
                2D, the objects don't interact (don't reflect and don't cast
                shadows on each other). Elements that do not always appear on
                the exact same spot (like a 3rd class merit medal) would also
                look perspectively wrong when put to a location where they were
                not originally rendered at. You therefore end up with a kind of
                2.5D look.<br>
                Second, working with the 3D data directly adds a new level of
                flexibility, like being able to set the camera and lighting,
                change the resolution, and so on.<br>
                <br>
                Of course, these advantages come at the price of a new level of
                complexity and - probably more to the concern of the users (*g*)
                - higher system requirements (see the <a href="TTT2_readme.htm#requirements">"Requirements"</a>
                section). But it also gives you more fun stuff to play with, so
                I hope you will enjoy this program. ;-)

                <h2>2. Disclaimer</h2>
                A lot of work and time was put into creating these uniforms <i>for
                  the Emperor's Hammer Strike Fleet</i>.<br>
                Any use of this material outside the EH (especially, but not
                restricted to, use for other SW clubs) require explicit
                permission from the Fleet Commander.<br>
                <br>
                Some parts of the geometry were inspired and/or taken from
                freeware sources which prohibit commercial use (please see the
                list of <a href="TTT2_readme.htm#contributors">contributors</a>).
                Some parts of the design are legal property of Lucasfilm Ltd.<br>
                Hence, the uniforms created by TTT3 can not be put to any
                commercial uses.<br>
                <br>
                While TTT3 allows you to set the camera position freely,
                pictures which you want to upload to the TC database must
                clearly show your position (cuff of at least one arm) and rank
                (left breast).<br>
                While the POV scripts that come with TTT3 allow for a high
                degree of customization, pictures you want to upload to the TC
                database must (obviously) obey EH OPS regulations.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, you are using the program on your own risk. Flawless
                operation of TTT3 on your system can't be guaranteed.
                <br>

                  <hr></a><br>
                <br>
                <h2>3. Requirements</h2>
                TTT3 uses the Persistence of Vision raytracer (in short POV-Ray)
                to create the uniform pictures. POV-Ray is freeware and can be
                downloaded from <a href="http://www.povray.org/" target="_blank">http://www.povray.org/</a>.
                You can install it to any directory, TTT3 <i>should</i> be able
                to find it via the registry. If that fails, please open TTT3's
                configuration dialog and set the path to your POV-Ray
                installation manually.<br>
                <br>
                On the hardware side, your machine can't really be fast enough.
                :P<br>
                Raytracers are number crunchers, so a CPU with some serious
                horsepower will help a lot. Your graphics card must support
                OpenGL for the previews, but the fastest GPU won't help you once
                the raytracing starts, so the overall quality of your graphics
                card isn't that important. The most important thing is a fast
                CPU... or even more than one, because the next version of
                POV-Ray will support multiple cores. :P<br>
                Running TTT3 with anything below 2 GHz will probably not be much
                fun.<br>
                <br>
                TTT3 has been deveoped and tested under and for Windows XP. It
                seems to work fine under Windows 98, too. No clue about Vista,
                but I'd be very, <i>very</i> suprised if it worked. Try it at
                your own risk.

                <h2>4. Rendering options</h2>
                As with previous versions of TTT, I think that most of the
                program functionality should be self-explaining. However, with
                the new 3D approach there are some aspects which are not that
                obvious. They will be explained in this section.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Cancel rendering</u>: You can always cancel POV-Ray by
                pressing Alt-G.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Camera and light movement</u>: Aside from moving the camera
                and the light source using the slider controls, you can also use
                a more intuitive method via the preview window:<br>
                With the left mouse button pressed, use the WSAD keys to
                navigate as in an FPS game. F and V move up and down.<br>
                With the left mouse button and ALT pressed, moving the mouse
                will rotate the camera around the scene center.<br>
                With the right mouse button pressed, moving the mouse will
                rotate the spotlight around the scene center. Note that, when in
                this mode, you will look at the scene from the spotlight's point
                of view to give you better control. Once you release the right
                mouse button, you will be switched back to camera view.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Mosaic preview mode</u>: There is a check box in the POV
                options (all previews) labeled "mosaic preview mode". With this
                enabled, POV-Ray will first generate a rough preview of the
                scene with large blocks, then refine them so more details become
                visible with every pass. Note that the final pass does not get
                done faster by this, so overall rendering time will increase.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Cloth detail (dress and duty uniforms only)</u>: There is a
                highly detailed cloth texture on the uniform that makes it look
                more realistic when viewed from close. But from far away, this
                leads to heavy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing"
                  target="_blank">aliasing</a> that looks like a Moiré pattern
                (if you really want to see the effect, switch from auto to
                highest quality and raytrace at standard camera setting and
                resolution).<br>
                To get a grip on that unpleasant affect, there are four versions
                of the cloth texture in different resolutions. With "Cloth
                detail" to "automatic", TTT3 will attempt to choose the best one
                based on two factors; output image width, and the distance
                between camera lens and uniform surface. Wow, you are really
                reading the readme, aren't you? You deserve a reward. If you are
                among the first three persons who write me a mail with "rtfm" in
                the topic, you can win a medal! Now back to the "Cloth detail"
                setting. Leaving that setting alone should work for most cases.
                However, the parameters for the texture choosing algo were set
                by a trial-and-error procedure since it is obviously not
                possible to test every configuration. So you may encounter
                situations in which you are not happy with the cloth detail. If
                you can't see it at all, increase the detail, if you get Moiré
                effects, decrease it. You may also want to save your scene
                settings and send them to me, for I might be able to improve the
                automatic algo to produce better results based on your
                experiment.

                Just a few things which I thought you might find useful.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Profiles</u>: In TTT3 you can save profiles from the main
                windows as well as from each preview window. This might seem
                confusing at first, but serves a purpose, which is keeping the
                uniform data and the <i>displaying</i> of the uniform data
                separate. So, for example, you can import a new officer's
                profile, but display it with your favorite camera and light
                settings which you have stored in a separate config file.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Speed up</u>: In some cases you may wish to only see a rough
                preview of a scene so you can judge how it would work out in the
                end. In such a case you wouldn't want to wait hours for the
                result. One of the biggest slowdowns in the raytracing process
                is the anti-aliasing. Switching it off makes the picture much
                rougher, but it will also go *a lot* faster. Getting rid of
                shadows and turning down the resolution are only points two and
                three on the list. Then there is the overall quality setting
                which goes from 9 down to 1. Here is what it does (from the
                POV-Ray help):<br>
                9: Compute media and radiosity<br>
                8: Compute reflected, refracted, and transmitted rays<br>
                6, 7: Compute texture patterns, compute photons<br>
                5: Render shadows, including extended lights<br>
                4: Render shadows, but no extended lights<br>
                2, 3: Show specified diffuse and ambient light<br>
                0, 1: Just show quick colors. Use full ambient lighting only.
                Quick colors are used only at 5 or below<br>
                <br>
                <u>Image formats</u>: TTT3 lets you save the generated image in
                JPG, PNG or BMP format. If possible you shouldn't go for JPG
                since that algo kinda sucks (one thing that <i>hasn't</i>
                changed from the old TTT). If you want a JPG image and have a
                graphics program, save as PNG or BMP first and to the conversion
                with that other proggie.

                <a name="patches">
                  <hr></a><br>
                <br>
                <h2>6. Squadron patches</h2>
                In order for a squadron patch to be displayed on the uniform, it
                must be in BMP or PNG format, it must be in the <i>data/squads</i>
                directory and it must be named after the squadron (same spelling
                that it has in TTT3).<br>
                A size of 256 x 256 pixels is recommended, but not enforced.
                Just make sure it is square because otherwise it will appear
                distorted.<br>
                You can define transparent areas by alpha channel (PNG format
                only), by using pure green (RGB 0, 255, 0) or the pixel colour
                of the leftmost uppermost (0, 0) pixel.<br>
                TTT3 will auto-generate a b/w mask from it and store it in the
                same directory under <i>originalname</i>_mask.gif. You don't
                have to care about it, but if you ever modify an existing patch,
                delete the GIF mask file that belongs to it, because as long as
                a mask file is in place TTT3 won't generate a new one.

                <a name="customize">
                  <hr></a><br>
                <br>
                <h2>7. Customization</h2>
                People who know me are aware of the fact that I'm of the
                old-fashioned opinion that uniforms should be, in fact, uniform.
                :P<br>
                Still, uniform customization has always been a hobby of many
                people in the EH, sometimes with good results, as even I have to
                admit. :P<br>
                Now with the new uniform system, that tradition seems to be
                doomed, or at least restricted to people who have expensive 3D
                modeling software and know how to use it. That is only partly
                true, though. As I mentioned several times already, TTT3 uses
                POV-Ray for output - and that is freeware. So what you can do
                is, after TTT3 has generated your uniform, look into the <i>data</i>
                directory, find the .pov file, save it under a new name (you
                should always do that because otherwise your changes will be
                overwritten next time TTT3 creates another uniform), and edit
                away. Sure, you might want to learn POV-Ray's scene description
                language first. But it comes with a good help file so I'm sure
                you'll be able to make small changes pretty quickly... and with
                time, also large ones.<br>
                The only thing you should never touch is the geometry itself...
                you'll see why after you had a look at how it is stored.

                TTT3 is finished apart from the medal case - and fixing bugs
                which will doubtlessly appear during the testing phase. TTT3
                therefore still has beta status.

                <h2>10. Known issues</h2>
                The following bugs and/or problems of the TTT3 software are
                known, but not getting fixed anytime soon for some reason or
                another.<br>
                <br>
                <u>Colour selection:</u> There is a problem in all colour
                selection dialogs. If you enter the desired colour by just
                typing in the RGB values, the colour preview won't update. You
                have to click into the colour map at least once to see any
                effect. The only way to fix it would be coding my own colour
                picker instead of using a prefab library, which is a little more
                trouble than I'd like to to go through to fix such a small
                issue. Sorry for the inconvenience, but I think you'll
                understand that.

                <h2>11. Bug reports</h2>
                The first rule of programming is still Murphy's.<br>
                Which is why I don't expect TTT3 to be free of bugs. There are
                just too many uniform configurations in which they can hide.<br>
                <br>
                If you encounter one, please save the uniform profiles and send
                them to me. If POV-Ray shuts down during the parsing phase,
                please open the .pov file, start the rendering "manually", and
                see what error message appears. Thanks in advance. :)

                Many people have had a share in the creation of both the new
                uniforms and this program. The contributions were of various
                kinds, so I will not try to measure and compare and determine
                who helped most, but list them alphabetically. I hope that
                nobody is left out. Thanks to:<br>
