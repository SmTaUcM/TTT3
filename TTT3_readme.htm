              <h2>1. Introduction: What is TTT?</h2>
              <p>TIECorps Tailoring Tool 3 is a program for creating Emperor's Hammer and TIE Corps
                uniforms.</p>
              <p>Since the template files for the uniforms are 3D models, which
                not too many people can easily work with, this tool is for
                assembling the uniform parts from given personnel data (either
                entered via the GUI or imported from the TC database).</p>
              <!--<p>TTT3 generates a preview in OpenGL, allowing the user to
              comfortably set camera position, lighting and some other
              options, and finally renders the final uniform image by calling
              POV-Ray (the Persistence of Vision raytracer).</p>-->
              <p>While it would have been easier and faster to just render out
                template pictures and have TTT put them together, as the first
                version of the program did, there would have been some
                disadvantages.</p>
              <p>First, when putting images together that look 3D, but are only
                2D, the objects don't interact (don't reflect and don't cast
                shadows on each other). Elements that do not always appear on
                the exact same spot (like a 3rd class merit medal) would also
                look perspectively wrong when put to a location where they were
                not originally rendered at. You therefore end up with a kind of
                2.5D look.</p>
              <p>Second, working with the 3D data directly adds a new level of
                flexibility, like being able to set the camera and lighting,
                change the resolution, and so on.</p>
              <br>

              <br>
              <h2>2. Disclaimer</h2>
              <p>A lot of work and time was put into creating these uniforms <i>for
                  the Emperor's Hammer Strike Fleet</i>.</p>
              <p>Any use of this material outside the EH (especially, but not
                restricted to, use for other SW clubs) require explicit
                permission from the Fleet Commander.</p>
              <p>Some parts of the geometry were inspired and/or taken from
                freeware sources which prohibit commercial use (please see the
                list of <a href="TTT3_readme.htm#contributors">contributors</a>).
                Some parts of the design are legal property of Lucasfilm Ltd.<br>
                Hence, the uniforms created by TTT3 can not be put to any
                commercial uses.</p>
              <p>
                While TTT3 allows you to set the camera position freely,
                pictures which you want to upload to the TC database must
                clearly show your position (cuff of at least one arm) and rank
                (left breast).</p>
              <p>While the POV scripts that come with TTT3 allow for a high
                degree of customization, pictures you want to upload to the TC
                database must (obviously) obey EH/TC uniform regulations.</p>
              <p>
                Finally, you are using the program on your own risk. Flawless
                operation of TTT3 on your system can't be guaranteed.</p>
              <br>

              <h2>3. Requirements</h2>
              <p>TTT3 uses the Persistence of Vision raytracer (in short POV-Ray)
                to create the uniform pictures. POV-Ray is freeware and can be
                downloaded from <a href="http://www.povray.org/" target="_blank">http://www.povray.org/</a>.
                You can install it to any directory, TTT3 <i>should</i> be able
                to find it via the registry. If that fails, please open TTT3's
                configuration dialog and set the path to your POV-Ray
                installation manually.</p>
              <p>TTT3 has been developed and tested primarily on Windows 10 64-bit. It has also been successfully tested
                on Windows 7 32-bit, and Windows 7 64-bit.</p>

              </a><br>
              <br>
              <h2>4. Rendering options</h2>
              <p></p>As with previous versions of TTT, most of the
              program functionality should be self-explaining. However, with
              the new 3D approach there are some aspects which are not that
              obvious. They will be explained in this section.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <u>Cancel rendering</u>: You can always cancel POV-Ray by
                  pressing Alt-G.
                </li>
                <!--<li>
                  <u>Camera and light movement</u>: Aside from moving the camera
                  and the light source using the slider controls, you can also use
                  a more intuitive method via the preview window:<br>
                  With the left mouse button pressed, use the WSAD keys to
                  navigate as in an FPS game. F and V move up and down.<br>
                  With the left mouse button and ALT pressed, moving the mouse
                  will rotate the camera around the scene center.<br>
                  With the right mouse button pressed, moving the mouse will
                  rotate the spotlight around the scene center. Note that, when in
                  this mode, you will look at the scene from the spotlight's point
                  of view to give you better control. Once you release the right
                  mouse button, you will be switched back to camera view.
                </li>-->
                <li>
                  <u>Mosaic preview mode</u>: There is a check box in the POV
                  options (all previews) labeled "mosaic preview mode". With this
                  enabled, POV-Ray will first generate a rough preview of the
                  scene with large blocks, then refine them so more details become
                  visible with every pass. Note that the final pass does not get
                  done faster by this, so overall rendering time will increase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Cloth detail (dress and duty uniforms only)</u>: There is a
                  highly detailed cloth texture on the uniform that makes it look
                  more realistic when viewed from close. But from far away, this
                  leads to heavy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing" target="_blank">aliasing</a> that looks
                  like a Moiré pattern
                  (if you really want to see the effect, switch from auto to
                  highest quality and raytrace at standard camera setting and
                  resolution).<br>
                  To get a grip on that unpleasant affect, there are four versions
                  of the cloth texture in different resolutions. With "Cloth
                  detail" to "automatic", TTT3 will attempt to choose the best one
                  based on two factors; output image width, and the distance
                  between camera lens and uniform surface. Leaving that setting alone should work for most cases.
                  However, the parameters for the texture choosing algo were set
                  by a trial-and-error procedure since it is obviously not
                  possible to test every configuration. So you may encounter
                  situations in which you are not happy with the cloth detail. If
                  you can't see it at all, increase the detail, if you get Moiré
                  effects, decrease it. You may also want to save your scene
                  settings and send them to me, for I might be able to improve the
                  automatic algo to produce better results based on your
                  experiment.

              <br>
              <h2>5. Tips from the author</h2>
              Just a few things which I thought you might find useful.

              <ul>

                <li><u>Profiles</u>: In TTT3 you can save profiles from the main
                  windows as well as from each preview window. This might seem
                  confusing at first, but serves a purpose, which is keeping the
                  uniform data and the <i>displaying</i> of the uniform data
                  separate. So, for example, you can import a new officer's
                  profile, but display it with your favorite camera and light
                  settings which you have stored in a separate config file.</li>
                <li>
                  <u>Speed up</u>: In some cases you may wish to only see a rough
                  preview of a scene so you can judge how it would work out in the
                  end. In such a case you wouldn't want to wait hours for the
                  result. One of the biggest slowdowns in the raytracing process
                  is the anti-aliasing. Switching it off makes the picture much
                  rougher, but it will also go *a lot* faster. Getting rid of
                  shadows and turning down the resolution are only points two and
                  three on the list. Then there is the overall quality setting
                  which goes from 9 down to 1. Here is what it does (from the
                  POV-Ray help):<br>
                  9: Compute media and radiosity<br>
                  8: Compute reflected, refracted, and transmitted rays<br>
                  6, 7: Compute texture patterns, compute photons<br>
                  5: Render shadows, including extended lights<br>
                  4: Render shadows, but no extended lights<br>
                  2-3: Show specified diffuse and ambient light<br>
                  0-1: Just show quick colors. Use full ambient lighting only.
                  Quick colors are used only at 5 or below
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Image formats</u>: TTT3 natively exports the generated image in PNG format.
                </li>

              </ul>
              <br>

              <br>
              <h2>6. Squadron patches</h2>
              <p>In order for a squadron patch to be displayed on the uniform, it
                must be in BMP or PNG format, it must be in the <i>data/squads</i>
                directory and it must be named after the squadron (same spelling
                that it has in TTT3).</p>
              <p>A size of 256 x 256 pixels is recommended, but not enforced.
                Just make sure it is square because otherwise it will appear
                distorted.</p>
              <p>You can define transparent areas by alpha channel (PNG format
                only), by using pure green (RGB 0, 255, 0) or the pixel colour
                of the leftmost uppermost (0, 0) pixel.
                TTT3 will auto-generate a b/w mask from it and store it in the
                same directory under <i>originalname</i>_mask.gif. You don't
                have to care about it, but if you ever modify an existing patch,
                delete the GIF mask file that belongs to it, because as long as
                a mask file is in place TTT3 won't generate a new one.</p>

              <h2>9. Bug reports</h2>
              The first rule of programming is still Murphy's.<br>
              Which is why I don't expect TTT3 to be free of bugs. There are
              just too many uniform configurations in which they can hide.<br>
              <br>
              If you encounter one, please save the uniform profiles and send
              them to me. If POV-Ray shuts down during the parsing phase,
              please open the .pov file, start the rendering "manually", and
              see what error message appears. Thanks in advance. :)

                this program. The contributions were of various
                kinds, so we will not try to measure and compare and determine
                who helped most, but list them alphabetically. Thanks to:</p>
