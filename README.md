#  TIE Corps Tailoring Tool 3
A 3D graphical rendering tool produced in Python to read PHP from a website, parse the data into an XML format and then dynamically launch the POV-Ray 3D tool and render a high-quality ray-traced jpeg image.

- **Description:** As a member of an online sci-fi video gaming club, members took on the alias of naval officers. As a part of being within the club required the creating of a uniform consisting of rank, position, squadron patch and medals. The club's existing tool was old, out of date and required maintenance. It was also compiled with no available source code. Using Python, Qt and POV-Ray I recreated the tool from scratch, implemented existing functionality and added enhanced features.

- **What I Learned:** I learned how to request and parse PHP retuned web data. I enhanced my PyQt skills and learned how to make attractive GUIs utilising CSS Stylesheets. I learned how to parse data into an XML format then interrogate a Windows operating system in order to find the version and location of POV-Ray, execute POV-Ray and extract a 3D ray-traced jpeg image.
