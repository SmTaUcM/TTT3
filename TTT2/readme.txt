-= TTT2 Update Pack v1.03 =-

This edition of Tempest's Tailoring Tool 2 includes the currently used ship/wing/squadrons
and displays the correct collar insignias and color schemes during raytracing.
It also includes the proper Knight FCHG symbol, General rank stripes
on the flight helmet for Flight Member and Flight Leader positions,
and new squadron patches.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!

1. This program is NOT compatible with POV-Ray v3.7. If you use 3.7, you won't
be able to render helmets properly and won't be able to save the rendered images
from within TTT2. Please use POV-Ray v3.6!

2. This program comes with Wing I color scheme by default. If you want to use it
for Wing II uniforms, please rename the 'dress_g.inc' file in 'TTT\data' to 
something else, and rename the 'dress_g-dred.inc' file to the one above.

3. If you import your profile via the Import tab, you will still have to select
your ship and wing! Everything else will be filled in for you, though.
