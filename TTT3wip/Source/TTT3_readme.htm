<A NAME="intro"><HR></A><BR>

<H2>1. Introduction: What is TTT?</H2>
Tempest's Tailoring Tool 2 is a program for creating EH TC uniforms.<BR>
Since the template files for the uniforms are 3D models, which not too many people can easily work with, this tool is for assembling the uniform parts from given personnel data (either entered via the GUI or imported from the TC database).<BR>
TTT2 generates a preview in OpenGL, allowing the user to comfortably set camera position, lighting and some other options, and finally renders the final uniform image by calling POV-Ray (the Persistence of Vision raytracer).<BR><BR>
While it would have been easier and faster to just render out template pictures and have TTT put them together, as the first version of the program did, there would have been some disadvantages.<BR>
First, when putting images together that look 3D, but are only 2D, the objects don't interact (don't reflect and don't cast shadows on each other). Elements that do not always appear on the exact same spot (like a 3rd class merit medal) would also look perspectively wrong when put to a location where they were not originally rendered at. You therefore end up with a kind of 2.5D look.<BR>
Second, working with the 3D data directly adds a new level of flexibility, like being able to set the camera and lighting, change the resolution, and so on.<BR><BR>
Of course, these advantages come at the price of a new level of complexity and - probably more to the concern of the users (*g*) - higher system requirements (see the <A HREF="TTT2_readme.htm#requirements">"Requirements"</A> section). But it also gives you more fun stuff to play with, so I hope you will enjoy this program. ;-)

<A NAME="disclaimer"><HR></A><BR><BR>

<H2>2. Disclaimer</H2>
A lot of work and time was put into creating these uniforms <I>for the Emperor's Hammer Strike Fleet</I>.<BR>
Any use of this material outside the EH (especially, but not restricted to, use for other SW clubs) require explicit permission from the Fleet Commander.<BR><BR>

Some parts of the geometry were inspired and/or taken from freeware sources which prohibit commercial use (please see the list of <A HREF="TTT2_readme.htm#contributors">contributors</A>). Some parts of the design are legal property of Lucasfilm Ltd.<BR>
Hence, the uniforms created by TTT2 can not be put to any commercial uses.<BR><BR>

While TTT2 allows you to set the camera position freely, pictures which you want to upload to the TC database must clearly show your position (cuff of at least one arm) and rank (left breast).<BR>
While the POV scripts that come with TTT2 allow for a high degree of customization, pictures you want to upload to the TC database must (obviously) obey EH OPS regulations.<BR><BR>

Finally, you are using the program on your own risk. Flawless operation of TTT2 on your system can't be guaranteed.
<BR><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="sub"><A HREF="TTT2_readme.htm#top">back to top</A></SPAN>

<A NAME="requirements"><HR></A><BR><BR>

<H2>3. Requirements</H2>
TTT2 uses the Persistence of Vision raytracer (in short POV-Ray) to create the uniform pictures. POV-Ray is freeware and can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.povray.org/" TARGET="_blank">http://www.povray.org/</A>. You can install it to any directory, TTT2 <I>should</I> be able to find it via the registry. If that fails, please open TTT2's configuration dialog and set the path to your POV-Ray installation manually.<BR><BR>
On the hardware side, your machine can't really be fast enough. :P<BR>
Raytracers are number crunchers, so a CPU with some serious horsepower will help a lot. Your graphics card must support OpenGL for the previews, but the fastest GPU won't help you once the raytracing starts, so the overall quality of your graphics card isn't that important. The most important thing is a fast CPU... or even more than one, because the next version of POV-Ray will support multiple cores. :P<BR>
Running TTT2 with anything below 2 GHz will probably not be much fun.<BR><BR>
TTT2 has been deveoped and tested under and for Windows XP. It seems to work fine under Windows 98, too. No clue about Vista, but I'd be very, <I>very</I> suprised if it worked. Try it at your own risk.
<BR><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="sub"><A HREF="TTT2_readme.htm#top">back to top</A></SPAN>

<A NAME="rendering"><HR></A><BR><BR>

<H2>4. Rendering options</H2>
As with previous versions of TTT, I think that most of the program functionality should be self-explaining. However, with the new 3D approach there are some aspects which are not that obvious. They will be explained in this section.<BR><BR>

<U>Cancel rendering</U>: You can always cancel POV-Ray by pressing Alt-G.<BR><BR>

<U>Camera and light movement</U>: Aside from moving the camera and the light source using the slider controls, you can also use a more intuitive method via the preview window:<BR>
With the left mouse button pressed, use the WSAD keys to navigate as in an FPS game. F and V move up and down.<BR>
With the left mouse button and ALT pressed, moving the mouse will rotate the camera around the scene center.<BR>
With the right mouse button pressed, moving the mouse will rotate the spotlight around the scene center. Note that, when in this mode, you will look at the scene from the spotlight's point of view to give you better control. Once you release the right mouse button, you will be switched back to camera view.<BR><BR>

<U>Mosaic preview mode</U>: There is a check box in the POV options (all previews) labeled "mosaic preview mode". With this enabled, POV-Ray will first generate a rough preview of the scene with large blocks, then refine them so more details become visible with every pass. Note that the final pass does not get done faster by this, so overall rendering time will increase.<BR><BR>

<U>Cloth detail (dress and duty uniforms only)</U>: There is a highly detailed cloth texture on the uniform that makes it look more realistic when viewed from close. But from far away, this leads to heavy <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing" TARGET="_blank">aliasing</A> that looks like a Moir&eacute; pattern (if you really want to see the effect, switch from auto to highest quality and raytrace at standard camera setting and resolution).<BR>
To get a grip on that unpleasant affect, there are four versions of the cloth texture in different resolutions. With "Cloth detail" to "automatic", TTT2 will attempt to choose the best one based on two factors; output image width, and the distance between camera lens and uniform surface. Wow, you are really reading the readme, aren't you? You deserve a reward. If you are among the first three persons who write me a mail with "rtfm" in the topic, you can win a medal! Now back to the "Cloth detail" setting. Leaving that setting alone should work for most cases. However, the parameters for the texture choosing algo were set by a trial-and-error procedure since it is obviously not possible to test every configuration. So you may encounter situations in which you are not happy with the cloth detail. If you can't see it at all, increase the detail, if you get Moir&eacute; effects, decrease it. You may also want to save your scene settings and send them to me, for I might be able to improve the automatic algo to produce better results based on your experiment.

<A NAME="tips"><HR></A><BR><BR>

<H2>5. Tips from the author</H2>
Just a few things which I thought you might find useful.<BR><BR>

<U>Profiles</U>: In TTT2 you can save profiles from the main windows as well as from each preview window. This might seem confusing at first, but serves a purpose, which is keeping the uniform data and the <I>displaying</I> of the uniform data separate. So, for example, you can import a new officer's profile, but display it with your favorite camera and light settings which you have stored in a separate config file.<BR><BR>

<U>Speed up</U>: In some cases you may wish to only see a rough preview of a scene so you can judge how it would work out in the end. In such a case you wouldn't want to wait hours for the result. One of the biggest slowdowns in the raytracing process is the anti-aliasing. Switching it off makes the picture much rougher, but it will also go *a lot* faster. Getting rid of shadows and turning down the resolution are only points two and three on the list. Then there is the overall quality setting which goes from 9 down to 1. Here is what it does (from the POV-Ray help):<BR>
9: Compute media and radiosity<BR>
8: Compute reflected, refracted, and transmitted rays<BR>
6, 7: Compute texture patterns, compute photons<BR>
5: Render shadows, including extended lights<BR>
4: Render shadows, but no extended lights<BR>
2, 3: Show specified diffuse and ambient light<BR>
0, 1: Just show quick colors. Use full ambient lighting only. Quick colors are used only at 5 or below<BR><BR>

<U>Image formats</U>: TTT2 lets you save the generated image in JPG, PNG or BMP format. If possible you shouldn't go for JPG since that algo kinda sucks (one thing that <I>hasn't</I> changed from the old TTT). If you want a JPG image and have a graphics program, save as PNG or BMP first and to the conversion with that other proggie.
<BR><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="sub"><A HREF="TTT2_readme.htm#top">back to top</A></SPAN>

<A NAME="patches"><HR></A><BR><BR>

<H2>6. Squadron patches</H2>
In order for a squadron patch to be displayed on the uniform, it must be in BMP or PNG format, it must be in the <I>data/squads</I> directory and it must be named after the squadron (same spelling that it has in TTT2).<BR>
A size of 256 x 256 pixels is recommended, but not enforced. Just make sure it is square because otherwise it will appear distorted.<BR>
You can define transparent areas by alpha channel (PNG format only), by using pure green (RGB 0, 255, 0) or the pixel colour of the leftmost uppermost (0, 0) pixel.<BR>
TTT2 will auto-generate a b/w mask from it and store it in the same directory under <I>originalname</I>_mask.gif. You don't have to care about it, but if you ever modify an existing patch, delete the GIF mask file that belongs to it, because as long as a mask file is in place TTT2 won't generate a new one.
<BR><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="sub"><A HREF="TTT2_readme.htm#top">back to top</A></SPAN>

<A NAME="customize"><HR></A><BR><BR>

<H2>7. Customization</H2>
People who know me are aware of the fact that I'm of the old-fashioned opinion that uniforms should be, in fact, uniform. :P<BR>
Still, uniform customization has always been a hobby of many people in the EH, sometimes with good results, as even I have to admit. :P<BR>
Now with the new uniform system, that tradition seems to be doomed, or at least restricted to people who have expensive 3D modeling software and know how to use it. That is only partly true, though. As I mentioned several times already, TTT2 uses POV-Ray for output - and that is freeware. So what you can do is, after TTT2 has generated your uniform, look into the <I>data</I> directory, find the .pov file, save it under a new name (you should always do that because otherwise your changes will be overwritten next time TTT2 creates another uniform), and edit away. Sure, you might want to learn POV-Ray's scene description language first. But it comes with a good help file so I'm sure you'll be able to make small changes pretty quickly... and with time, also large ones.<BR>
The only thing you should never touch is the geometry itself... you'll see why after you had a look at how it is stored.

<A NAME="status"><HR></A><BR><BR>

<H2>8. Project status</H2>
TTT2 is finished apart from the medal case - and fixing bugs which will doubtlessly appear during the testing phase. TTT2 therefore still has beta status.

<H2>9. User FAQ</H2>
No questions yet.
<BR><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="sub"><A HREF="TTT2_readme.htm#top">back to top</A></SPAN>

<A NAME="issues"><HR></A><BR><BR>

<H2>10. Known issues</H2>
The following bugs and/or problems of the TTT2 software are known, but not getting fixed anytime soon for some reason or another.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Colour selection:</U> There is a problem in all colour selection dialogs. If you enter the desired colour by just typing in the RGB values, the colour preview won't update. You have to click into the colour map at least once to see any effect. The only way to fix it would be coding my own colour picker instead of using a prefab library, which is a little more trouble than I'd like to to go through to fix such a small issue. Sorry for the inconvenience, but I think you'll understand that.
<BR><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="sub"><A HREF="TTT2_readme.htm#top">back to top</A></SPAN>

<A NAME="bugs"><HR></A><BR><BR>

<H2>11. Bug reports</H2>
The first rule of programming is still Murphy's.<BR>
Which is why I don't expect TTT2 to be free of bugs. There are just too many uniform configurations in which they can hide.<BR><BR>
If you encounter one, please save the uniform profiles and send them to me. If POV-Ray shuts down during the parsing phase, please open the .pov file, start the rendering "manually", and see what error message appears. Thanks in advance. :)
